# 0x0F. C - Function pointers

# Tasks
### What's my name
*	Write a function that prints a name.

### If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done
*	Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.

### To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities
*	Write a function that searches for an integer.

### A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at
*	 Write a program that performs simple operations.
Usage: calc num1 operator num2
You can assume num1 and num2 are integers, so use the atoi function to convert them from the string input to int
operator is one of the following:
+: addition
-: subtraction
*: multiplication
/: division
%: modulo
The program prints the result of the operation, followed by a new line
You can assume that the result of all operations can be stored in an int
if the number of arguments is wrong, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 98
if the operator is none of the above, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 99
if the user tries to divide (/ or %) by 0, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 100
This task requires that you create four different files.
*	3-calc.h
*		This file should contain all the function prototypes and data structures used by the program.
*	3-op_functions.c

This file should contain the 5 following functions (not more):

op_add: returns the sum of a and b. Prototype: int op_add(int a, int b);
op_sub: returns the difference of a and b. Prototype: int op_sub(int a, int b);
op_mul: returns the product of a and b. Prototype: int op_mul(int a, int b);
op_div: returns the result of the division of a by b. Prototype: int op_div(int a, int b);
op_mod: returns the remainder of the division of a by b. Prototype: int op_mod(int a, int b);

*	3-get_op_func.c

This file should contain the function that selects the correct function to perform the operation asked by the user. You’re not allowed to declare any other function.

Prototype: int (*get_op_func(char *s))(int, int);
where s is the operator passed as argument to the program
This function returns a pointer to the function that corresponds to the operator given as a parameter. Example: get_op_func("+") should return a pointer to the function op_add
You are not allowed to use switch statements
You are not allowed to use for or do ... while loops
You are not allowed to use goto
You are not allowed to use else
You are not allowed to use more than one if statement in your code
You are not allowed to use more than one while loop in your code
If s does not match any of the 5 expected operators (+, -, *, /, %), return NULL

*	3-main.c

This file should contain your main function only.

You are not allowed to code any other function than main in this file
You are not allowed to directly call op_add, op_sub, op_mul, op_div or op_mod from the main function
You have to use atoi to convert arguments to int
You are not allowed to use any kind of loop
You are allowed to use a maximum of 3 if statements
