This is the beginning of c programming language
         Hello, World
Making use of variables; if, if_else and while.

0-Positive anything is better than negative nothing- This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
The output of the program should be: The number, followed by, if the number is greater than 0: is positive, if the number is 0: is zero, if the number is less than 0: is negative; followed by a new line

1-The last digit- This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.
The output of the program should be:
The string Last digit of, followed by n, followed by the string is, followed by if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5 if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0 if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0. followed by a new line

2-I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game-Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etcâ€¦) is forbidden)

3-alphABET- Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
        You can only use the putchar function.

4-When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. Print all the letters except q and e You can only use the putchar function

5 - Numbers - Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

6 - Numberz - Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

7 - Smile in the mirror - Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. You can only use the putchar function

8 - Hexadecimal - Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.You can only use the putchar function.

9 - Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success - Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.%) Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
