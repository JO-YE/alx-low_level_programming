# 0x0B. C - malloc, free

# Tasks
### Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
*	Write a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.
Prototype: char *create_array(unsigned int size, char c);
Returns NULL if size = 0
Returns a pointer to the array, or NULL if it fails.

### The woman who has no imagination has no wings
*	Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
Prototype: char *_strdup(char *str);
The _strdup() function returns a pointer to a new string which is a duplicate of the string str. Memory for the new string is obtained with malloc, and can be freed with free.
Returns NULL if str = NULL
On success, the _strdup function returns a pointer to the duplicated string. It returns NULL if insufficient memory was available

### He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life
*	Write a function that concatenates two strings.

### If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize
*	Write a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.
